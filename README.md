# Kernels4graphs

## Description

Kernels4graphs implements several kernel based methods for classification of graphs. A basic SVM algorithm and 4 different graph Kernels implementations are provided. The different approaches have been applied to Structure-Activity Relationship Analysis (SAR) to predict the molecular activity of differente chemical compounds described as labeled graphs. The different approaches have been compared and the results are presened in the file report.pdf.
The kernels implemented here are:

+ Nth order walk kernel 
+ Geometric walk kernel 
+ Markovian random walk kernel
+ Subtree kernel


## Dependencies

+ Networkx
+ Numpy
+ sklearn
+ rdkit
+ cvxopt
